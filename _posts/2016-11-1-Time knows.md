## Summary and Future Plan

Time passes by, it has over two months since my first come to Johns Hopkins University and Baltimore.

Not so good.

Four courses in the first semester. Network Security is quite hard, not so used to the style of teacher, not so good at programming with Python, not so good with cooperate with other guys, can not finish homework individually. A little nervous and disappointed to myself.

Security Analytics, not bad, workload is fine, a brief description about method and knowledge in Machine Learning, hope having a deeper understand about the knowledge.

Security and Privacy in Computing. Mainly focus on the programming with JavaScript, it will be hard in the future because of ppor knowledge about the JavaScript. 

Life is hard, work is normal, rest is rare. You should get used to it and try to adopt the situation. 

No one is necessity. Friendship is cheap. 

Follow your heart, you have life, you do not need to worry about money, your family is complete. nothing is wrong.  

Stoping wasting time, time knows everything. Apologize and regret is too late.

Enjoy the moment. Future is colorlful.

You have so much possibility in the future.

Things done by people.

事在人为，没有永远的盟友，没有永远的舒适。
